    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's technologically driven society, social media (especially Twitter) often acts as a central repository for thoughts, feelings, and opinions. Fortunately, technology has also provided a means by which we can attempt to evaluate or analyze some of those opinions. Through the use of machine learning and natural language processing, we will identify users who have expressed dissatisfaction with Apple and Google products. The objective is to categorize tweets related to Apple and Google into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments, providing actionable insights for their advertising strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will build a predictive model that can monitor recent tweets about various technology brands. Consumer sentiment is a key indicator of purchasing decisions and, by extension, the financial performance of the companies behind these products. Their goal is to use sentiment analysis to filter and identify brands with positive consumer emotions, thereby guiding their investment decisions. We will utilize supervised modeling processes and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to solve the tweet sentiment classification problem using an advanced dataset."

    "### Business Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin exploring the data we first need to understand why an NLP model that can predict sentiment would be useful. In this dataset we have numerous tweets that are centered around either Apple or Google products and the SXSW Festival. The SXSW festival draws thousands of people each year and provides large tech companies such as Apple or Google to showcase their products and services to understand how much engagement and interest they garner from the attendees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tweets included were sent out during the South by South West conference. A model can then analyze each of those tweets and we can have near instant feedback on how people feel. We can gain an understanding of features that were well received and possibly gain insight as to what things need improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop an initial Proof of Concept (PoC) for a sentiment analysis model that can classify Tweets about Apple and Google products into positive or negative sentiments. Once a reliable binary classifier is achieved, extend it to include neutral sentiments for a more comprehensive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary business problem is to ensure the best possibe experience for customers by accurately prediciting whether a  given tweet expresses positive or negative sentiment about Apple or Google products. Misclassifying negative sentiments as positive (Fals Positives) can lead to misleading insights, which might result in poor strategic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sentiment Analysis Model: Develop a model that can accurately classify Tweets into positive, negative, or neither based  on their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Minimize False Positives: Focus on rreducing the instances where the model incorrectly identifies a negatives sentiment as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Maximize Accuarcy and Precision: Ensure the model is relaible by tartgeting high accuracy precision metrics."
