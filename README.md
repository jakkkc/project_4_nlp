## Business Understanding
### Overview

In today's tech-driven society, social media (especially Twitter) acts as a repository for thoughts, feelings, and opinions. Using machine learning and natural language processing, we will identify users expressing dissatisfaction with Apple and Google products. The objective is to categorize tweets into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments, providing actionable insights for advertising strategies.

This project leverages Twitter sentiment analysis to understand user sentiments towards Apple and Google products. It involves collecting Twitter data related to product reviews, followed by preprocessing and sentiment analysis. Insights derived will guide product assortment optimization and strategic alignment with customer preferences.

### Challenges:
The lack of systematic sentiment analysis on Twitter hinders data-driven stocking decisions. This project aims to use sentiment analysis to understand customer opinions better. By gaining insights into these sentiments, we can enhance stocking decisions, align products with customer preferences, and boost satisfaction and loyalty.

### Business Problem:
The primary business problem is to ensure the best possible customer experience by accurately predicting whether a tweet expresses positive or negative sentiment about Apple or Google products. Misclassifying sentiments can lead to misleading insights and poor strategic decisions.

#### Research Questions
What are the main sentiments expressed by customers on Twitter regarding iPhone and Google products?
What factors affect the polarity of tweets related to iPhone and Google products on Twitter?
Which features of iPhone and Google products are most commonly praised or criticized by users on Twitter?
Which machine learning model is the most effective for sentiment analysis?

## Data Understanding
Contributors evaluated tweets about multiple brands and products, indicating positive, negative, or no emotion towards a brand/product. If emotion was expressed, they identified the target brand/product.
Tweets were mostly about Google and Apple products during the South by Southwest conference in 2013.
The dataset includes 9,093 rows with three columns: tweet text, tweet subject, and tweet emotion.
Data comes from CrowdFlower via data.world.
Human raters classified the sentiment in over 9,000 tweets as positive, negative, neither, or "can't tell." The "can't tell" category will be dropped from the analysis.
